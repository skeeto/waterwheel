# Waterwheel simulation (chaotic motion)

Online demo: http://nullprogram.com/waterwheel/

This is a dynamic simulation of a waterwheel. Water flows quickly into
the topmost bucket, and slowly flows out from every bucket through a
small hole in the bottom. The waterwheel is simulated in JavaScript,
integrated with RK4, and rendered using an HTML5 canvas.
